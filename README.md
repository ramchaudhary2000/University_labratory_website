## Research Lab Website Design Template

This is a research lab website template that can be used by university students / professors to create a simple website for showing and displaying their labs / research. 

I built this for my brother years ago, and you can find his current site here: [Gautam Buddha University Experimental Research Lab](https://www.gbu.ac.in/)

You can find a live view of the template using the link below.
